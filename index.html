        <p>Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was so much more than just the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was just like a grandfather to Harry and guided all of us throught some of the darkest times in the Wizarding World. He was a kind, powerful, mysterious and wise person. He never hesitated to sacrifise for all his students and even strangers.</p>
